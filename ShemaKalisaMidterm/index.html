								<p> 
						        MY HYPOTHESIS: 
								
								The people want a mobile application dedicated to Tasty.

								<ul>
								<li>Tasty Videos.</li>
								<li>Tasty Recipes.</li>
								<li>Tasty Shopping.</li>
								<li>Tasty Community Hot Takes.</li>
								</ul>
								 <p>Tasty is more than entertainment. Tasty is a plan, a shopping list and a meal. Tasty is discovery and knowledge. 

                                A dedicated Tasty app must exist. For the culture.</p>  

								<span class="image main"><img src="../ShemaKalisaMidterm/images/giphy%20migos.gif"alt="" /></span>
 
								<p>

								I needed to confirm this hypothesis, while at the same time confronting a serious lack of data. I decided to look to the people. 
							    
							     <ul>
                                   The data and how I used it:
								  <li> I read a years worth of Buzzfeed Video reviews on the US iOS App Store. The reviews were from 2/12/16 through 2/12/17.</li>
							
								  <li> I tallied and logged reviews highlighting Tasty specifically.</li>
								  <li> I tallied and logged the number of times other shows were mentioned.</li>
								  <li> Looked for existing products and communties that align with hypothesis and demonstrate market validation.</li>
								 </ul>

								 </p>

                                 <h3 class="major">A brief review of the reviews</h3>
                                 <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/gojimgo.co/spreadsheets/d/1tph06-ahG-3kcbjeUdL5OZ6j2d22n3YhbH6VkqonhKg/edit?usp=sharing">A VERY NICE SPREADSHEET.</a>
                                 
                                 <h5 class="major">81 reviews explicitly cite Tasty as content that drives engagement. </h5>
                                 <p> 10 of these reviews mentioned other shows.</p>
                                 <ul>
                                 <li>Try Guys: 4 reviews. </li>

                                  <p> 10% of users in the sample explicitly cite Tasty as one of the reasons they use the Buzzfeed App.</p>

                                  Number of reviews explicitly citing other shows:
